The CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language designed for early video game development. It was used primarily in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It has a simple set of instructions and a 4K memory space. Here's a breakdown of how CHIP-8 instructions work:

1. **Memory Layout:**

   The CHIP-8 system has 4K memory, usually divided as follows:

   - `0x000-0x1FF`: Reserved for the CHIP-8 interpreter itself.
   - `0x200-0xFFF`: Usable memory for programs and data.

2. **Registers:**

   CHIP-8 has 16 general-purpose 8-bit registers (V0 to VF) and a special register called the "carry flag" (VF) used for borrow/carry operations.

3. **Stack and Stack Pointer:**

   CHIP-8 has a stack that allows the program to call and return from subroutines. The stack is used to store return addresses. The stack pointer (SP) keeps track of the current level in the stack.

4. **Timers:**

   CHIP-8 has two timers:

   - Delay timer: Decrements at a rate of 60 Hz until it reaches 0.
   - Sound timer: Similar to the delay timer but used for sound. When it's non-zero, a sound is usually produced.

5. **Instructions:**

   CHIP-8 instructions are 2 bytes long and are stored in memory in big-endian format.

   - **0x0NNN:** Calls RCA 1802 machine code routine at address NNN.
   - **0x00E0:** Clears the screen.
   - **0x00EE:** Returns from a subroutine.
   - **0x1NNN:** Jumps to address NNN.
   - **0x2NNN:** Calls subroutine at NNN.
   - **0x3XNN:** Skips the next instruction if VX equals NN.
   - **0x4XNN:** Skips the next instruction if VX doesn't equal NN.
   - **0x5XY0:** Skips the next instruction if VX equals VY.
   - **0x6XNN:** Sets VX to NN.
   - **0x7XNN:** Adds NN to VX.
   - **0x8XY0:** Sets VX to the value of VY.
   - **0x8XY1:** Sets VX to VX OR VY.
   - **0x8XY2:** Sets VX to VX AND VY.
   - **0x8XY3:** Sets VX to VX XOR VY.
   - ... and more operations with various codes in the 8XY0 format.
   - **0xFX07:** Sets VX to the value of the delay timer.
   - **0xFX0A:** A key press is awaited, and then stored in VX.
   - **0xFX15:** Sets the delay timer to VX.
   - **0xFX18:** Sets the sound timer to VX.
   - **0xFX1E:** Adds VX to I.
   - **0xFX29:** Sets I to the location of the sprite for the character in VX.
   - ... and more operations with various codes in the FX07 format.

   You can find a comprehensive list of CHIP-8 instructions along with their details in the CHIP-8 documentation.

6. **Execution:**

   The CHIP-8 interpreter fetches an instruction, decodes it, executes it, and moves to the next instruction. The instructions may include branching, jumps, and subroutines.

7. **Graphics:**

   CHIP-8 supports basic graphics using a monochrome 64x32 pixel display. The graphics are drawn using XOR operations.

8. **Input:**

   CHIP-8 has a 16-key hexadecimal keypad. Each key corresponds to a hex digit.

The above breakdown provides a high-level overview of how CHIP-8 instructions work. If you're interested in developing CHIP-8 programs or emulators, there are resources available online that go into more detail about the instructions, memory mapping, and other aspects of CHIP-8 programming.
